# Hacky AdvancedEnchantments
Better Enchantments &amp; Curses, but *way* more jank
*Tested in Paper 1.15.2*

Modifications made by a literal monkey (me):

- (tried to) fix a bug where after a while AE would stop giving custom enchants by removing the enchantment weight updating mechanism with new config option

- ~~fixed the XP taken bug by using the button pressed to determine XP loss instead of the level required (no more losing 30 levels)~~ patched in master

- enchant preview hider is now a config option

- ~~removed the limit on enchantment levels using /ae set when "force" is true~~ patched in master

- Added "Acceleration" enchant that works like Antigravity but it makes you run fast instead (Incompatible with Antigravity and Protection for "balance")

- Added the ability for curses to show up when enchanting, controlled by config option

- ~~Many balance changes~~ basically all of them are in master

Huge and enourmous thanks to egg82 for making his code so easy to mod. I don't actually know java...
